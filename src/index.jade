            i  Tic Tac Toe
            is a simple game which, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. However, many players (especially younger children) still enjoy it, and Tic Tac Toe can be made significantly more complex by increasing the size of the board.

          li 3. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three OS in a row, that player wins.
          li 4. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
